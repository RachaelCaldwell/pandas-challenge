The Module 4 Challenge manipulates Pandas DataFrames to:
* analyze district-wide standardized test results
* aggregate the standardized testing data to showcase obvious trends in school performance

**District Summary** <br>
A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics to include:
* Total number of unique schools
* Total students
* Total budget
* Average math score
* Average reading score
* % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
* % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
* % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)<br><br>

**School Summary** <br>
A DataFrame that summarizes key metrics about each school to include:
* School name
* School type
* Total students
* Total school budget
* Per student budget
* Average math score
* Average reading score
* % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
* % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
* % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)<br><br>

**Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)** <br>
A Dataframe that sorts the highest-performing schools by % Overall Passing in descending order.

A breakdown of school performance data based on average spending ranges (per student) to include:
* Average math score
* Average reading score
* % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
* % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
* % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)<br><br>

**Scores by School Size** <br>
A DataFrame that breaks down school performance based on school size (small, medium, or large).
